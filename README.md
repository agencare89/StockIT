A project developed during the Web Technologies course. This project involves NodeJS server code, with a combination of HTML with BootStrap and JavaScript with JQuery to create an application based on stocks in the NYSE Top 100. This application also utilizes the Passport authentication API for user sessions, and the Yahoo Finance API for stock information.
